Although SVB was bankruptcy due to the liquidity squeeze after federal rate continuous increase in the past two years, the quality of the business especially lending business run well after M&A. The successful of SVB business model prove that the loan to early business can earn decent return once the credit risk is monitored. 


On the other side, the defi lending protocols focus more on individuals lending with over-collateral to mitigate the credit risk. There is plenty of liquidity need from projects is not covered by these lending protocol. Meanwhile individual investors are looking for early stage projects to invest. The fair launch spirit on BTC boom prove that individual investor is keen on join the project as early as possible. 

This comes Crebit, a lending protocol to meet the needs of project and liquidity providers/investors by leverage defi framework and SVB model. This will enhance the capital efficiency that project no need over-collateral their assets to get loan while individual investors can get token and interest by providing the liquidity.
