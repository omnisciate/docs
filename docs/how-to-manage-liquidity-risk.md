To enhance the capital efficiency and retain enough funds for liquidity, the funds in the lending pool will deposit into leading lending protocol (ie AAVE, Compound) to generate yield. The idle funds is subject to deposit into other protocols by DAO voting.

Only the deposit in AAVE/Compound can be withdraw immediately to liquidity provider. Once the withdraw request is up to the limit, the funds will be remitted to the liquidity providers after the lending to protocol expire based on FCFS.
